# About TYPEMILL

TYPEMILL is a small system to create a website based on Markdown files. It is perfect for web books, online manuals or documentations.

To create a website, simply add your Markdown files to the content folder of TYPEMILL. TYPEMILL will take your files and folders and create a website with a corresponding navigation.

TYPEMILL is a lightweight tool for writers, who do not want to fiddle around with complicated technology. If you are a developer, you can easily craft your own theme based on the template language Twig.
