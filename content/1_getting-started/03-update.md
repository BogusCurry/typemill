# Update

If your TYPEMILL version or any plugin or theme is not up to date, you will find update notices in the author panel. 

## Simple Update

To update your TYPEMILL version, simply download the latest version of TYPEMILL on [the TYPEMILL website](http://typemill.net). Then delete the old `system` folder on your server and upload the new system folder. 

## Major Update

TYPEMILL is in early stage and there are a lot of basic changes right now. When there are basic changes, then you should update everything like this:

* Backup your settings folder
* Keep your content folder
* Delete everything else:
  * cache
  * plugins
  * settings
  * system
  * themes
* Upload the new folders 
* Go to `your-typemill-website.com/setup` and create a new user.
* Setup your website again in the author panel.

In most cases you can also user your old settings-file from your backup, but if it does not work, simply setup the system again.
