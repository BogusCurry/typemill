# Use Cases

Whenever you want to publish a finished text work as a website and if you like writing with Markdown, then TYPEMILL is a smart and lightweight solution. Possible use cases are ...

- a documentation
- a manual
- a user guide
- a whitepaper
- a handbook
- a tutorial
- a study
- a book
- a drama
- a lyric collection
- a collection of articles

If you want to create a blog, a wiki or a classic corporate website, please use a specialized CMS for that instead of TYPEMILL.

TYPEMILL is under heavy developement and not finished right now. It has an admin panel for settings, but it does not provide an online content editor at the moment. An online editor and different output formats like mobi and ePup are on the roadmap, so stay tuned.

For time being, you can use an offline markdown-editor like Typora and upload your content-files with a FTP software like FileZilla.
