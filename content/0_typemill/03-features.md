# Features

TYPEMILL has a limited set of features right now. It transforms a bunch of **markdown files** into a **website** and generates a list of contents for **navigation**. 

This is what you can **do with TYPEMILL**:

- Create a website content with simple folders and files (markdown).
- Use an author panel to configure your site, choose themes and activate plugins.
- Create your own theme with HTML, CSS and Twig (a template language for PHP).
- Create your own plugins.

This is, what **TYPEMILL does** for you:

- It creates a website based on your folders and files.
- It generates a navigation according to the structure of your folders and files.
- It adds a paging.
- It adds a breadcrumb.
- It adds hierarchic numbers to your chapters and pages.
- It makes everything responsive for mobile devices.

Right now there is no content editor, so you have to create and edit your content offline with a markdown editor and upload the files with an FTP software. 

But a content editor will follow soon and we have a great roadmap for TYPEMILL.
