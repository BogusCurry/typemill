# Roadmap

There are a lot of plans for future releases of TYPEMILL, but it also follows the concept of simplicity. To prevent TYPEMILL from becomming a feature soup, it will strictly focus on the writers needs. These are some ideas:  

- Image and media support.
- A dashboard for authors to create and edit content online.
- More themes for special publications like documentations, books or lyrics.
- Additional navigation based on the headlines of a content page.
- Extensibility (Plugins) and API design.
- Version controll and updates.
- Additional output format like mobi, epub, static html and more.

If you miss a feature or if you found a bug, please report it on GitHub.
