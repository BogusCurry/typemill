#About TYPEMILL

TYPEMILL is a simple flat file CMS to create a website like this. It transforms a bunch of **text files** (Markdown) into a **website** and generates a **navigation**. TYPEMILL is under construction and provides a simple admin area for settings right now. An online editor and different output formats for e-books like mobi and epub are on their way. If you are a developer: TYPEMILL already supports themes and plugins.
